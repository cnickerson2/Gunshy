# High Concept Document

**Basic Concept:**

Also known as Mahjongg Solitaire, Gunshy is an ancient Chinese puzzle game where the player must clear a board of tiles by removing identical pairs that do not disturb any other pieces.

**Objective:**

 The player wins the game if they remove all pairs of tiles from the board. They will lose the game if there are no more pairs they can remove from play. The faster the player completes the game, the higher the score they get.

**Gameplay:**

The player will choose two available, identical tiles and remove them from the board. A tile is considered available if it can be moved to the left or to the right without disturbing another tile.

There are 36 different tile sets, with each tile set having 4 tiles (144 tiles total).

There are multiple patterns that can be used for the layout of the tiles, but the classic way is the Turtle; a 4-level pyramid with arms on the top and bottom. Please see picture for example.

**Target Audience:        **

Our target audience is intended to be adults between 30 and 60. This market of gamers are likely to have smart phones in which to play these games but are likely to use puzzle games as a low-intensity brain-training exercise.

**Target Game Platform:**

The target platforms we chose to go with for our game is Android and iOS platforms. This allows users to take the game on the go with them, and allows us to monetize via ads, while giving the game away for free.
